# React Web challenge

The goal is to create a web app to allow to assign roles to users.

It should store the info in the local storage but if an external storage with an endpoint server is used that'll be more valuable (i.e. firebase).

The user should be able to create users (name, email, password and any other property you consider important).

Those users with `admin` roles should be able to create users and to assign them to different roles.

Each role should have an specific set of permissions (edit, create, delete).

# Steps to deliver the challenge

- Create a PR from your own repo to this repo.

- Assign one of Tarmac's developers for code review.

*Good Luck*
